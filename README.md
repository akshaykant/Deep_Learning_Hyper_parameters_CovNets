# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

This assignment-based course is focused on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students who do this course will have experience in the design, implementation, training, and evaluation of machine learning systems.

Activation functions help Artificial Neural Networks to learn and make sense of the nonlinearity between the inputs and outputs. Weight initialisation and regularisation techniques are ways to improve the model, which can be further extended using learning rule optimisation techniques and normalisation techniques. Deep neural networks are difficult to train and making a better learning model is to play around with different hyper parameters, optimisation and normalisation techniques, tweaking them and bringing a right fit among them. This report extends to Convolution Neural Networks., mixing hyper parameters, optimisation and normalisation techniques and building multilayer convolution neural networks.

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the course that students will implement parts of and extend during the course labs and assignments,
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing explanatory material and coding exercises to be completed during the course labs.
